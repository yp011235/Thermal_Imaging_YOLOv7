# Thermal Imaging YOLOv7

Summary: Using LabelIMG, I annotated 60 images in Black Hot Thermal Imaging and 60 in Fusion Thermal Imaging. I then trained weights on them using YOLOv7 and uploaded the results. After multiple different iterations of training for 6-7 hours at a time, Black Hot Thermal Imaging was the most reliable way to track people and poachers through the woods.

# Tools

LabelIMG: To annotate images that will be used for training and testing

YOLOv7: An advanced CNN that works in real time with a good balance of speed and accuracy.
